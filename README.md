# Energy-Efficiency-Prediction
Predicting energy efficiency in buildings using regression. Data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation

Description:
This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project focused on predicting energy efficiency in buildings. 

Key Highlights:
- Data Exploration and Visualization: Dive into the dataset comprising nine features and a target variable, exploring the characteristics of different building shapes, glazing area, orientation, and more.
- Data Preprocessing: Implement data preprocessing techniques, including splitting the data into training and test sets, handling missing values, and performing useful data transformations.
- Feature Selection: Consider feature selection methods to enhance model performance and achieve better predictions.
- Regression Algorithms: Implement various regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Elastic Net Regression, Polynomial Regression with regularization, and even Neural Networks.
- Model Tuning: Tune the models using the training set to optimize their performance.
- Model Selection: Choose the two best-performing models for evaluation on the test set.
- Python Jupyter Notebook: The code, comments, and explanations are provided in a Python Jupyter notebook, ensuring transparency and reproducibility of results.
